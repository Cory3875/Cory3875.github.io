		<h2> Description of Project </h2>
		<p>My project is a game where you have to answer semi-complex math problems that become increasingly more difficult as you get more problems correct, but if you get one incorrect, you must start over. It starts with addition and finally ends with divison and multiplication
		<h2>Reflection of Project </h2>
		<p>Although the concept of the project seems easy, we stumbled onto many problems such as; making 2 while loops, one for stopping the game when your done, and another for resetting the game for getting a question incorrect. We also had trouble with coming up with a system that could both generate random math problems, and check it's self based on what the user put in as the answer.

		<p>This bit of code is where it first asks the question to the user and depending on if the user types the right answer, they will be able to move onto the next level. The program checks the user's answer by taking the answer and subracting it from the 2nd integer in the equation, and if it equals the first integer, the user is able to move on.
